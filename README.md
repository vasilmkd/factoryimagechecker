# factoryimagechecker

Small Android app aimed at Nexus Warriors (shamu and angler) who are still waiting for the official Nougat Factory Images to drop for their phones.

The app uses GCMNetworkManager to schedule a service which checks for the existence of the Factory Images.

The app compiled using the Jack toolchain, which is used to backport Java 8 features (lambdas are used in this app).
